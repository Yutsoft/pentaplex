#+TITLE: pentaplex
#+AUTHOR: phdenzel

  A receipt scanner and reader which makes use of tesseract-ocr and
  imagemagick.
  It executes five basic functionalities (hence the program's name):
     1. scan receipt image (/edge detection and warp transformation with opencv/)
     2. preprocess scan (/clean, sharpen, and contrast/)
     3. run OCR (/tesseract for optical character recognition/)
     4. analyze OCR output (/with fuzzy finder and preconfigured dictionary/)
     5. summarize analysis in a csv file

  To prepare for the scanning of the receipts, create a directory called
  ~imgs/~ in the repository, and place pictures of the receipts in it;
  e.g. in Terminal (after ~cd~ into the repository) type something of the sort:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    mkdir -p imgs/
    cp ~/Downloads/*.JPG imgs/
  #+END_SRC

*** Prerequisites

    This program uses

    - [[https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php][imagemagick]]
    - [[https://github.com/opencv/opencv][opencv]]

*** Usage
    
    To run pentaplex type (of course first ~cd~ into repository):
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      ./pentaplex [optional: auto]
    #+END_SRC
